# A-Netflix-dataset-Analysis
Played with a Netflix Dataset in Tableau

Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service and production company based in Los Gatos, California. Founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California, it offers a film and television series library through distribution deals as well as its own productions, known as Netflix Originals.

The dataset contains information from 2008 to 2020.

1. Area Chart of Total Movies & TV Shows added over the years from 2008 to 2020:
* Highest Number of Movies were uploaded in the year 2019 with the count of 1546
* Whereas Highest number of Tv shows were uploaded in the year 2019 with the count of 147
* I can see Netflix's content upload saw the steep rise during the course of years from 2014 to 2019 and reached its peak in 2019

2. A generated Map showing Total Movies & TV Shows by Country. 
* USA has the highest number of content uploaded by netflix with the lead of 2032
* Followed by India, Netflix uploaded 777 contents.
* While Canada, Russia, China, Argentine Brazil, Australia show modest number of content uploads.

3. Top 10 Genre
* Using Horizontal Bar, I found genres namely Documentaries(299), Stand-Up Comedy(273), 'Dramas, International Movies'(248) were on the top of genres list of both movies and Tv shows
* Genre 'Comedy, International Movies' has lowest release.

4. Movies & TV Shows distribution:
* I plotted Packed Bubble chart for finding Movies and tv shows distribution.
* 68.42% contains Movies and the rest of content ie. 31% is Tv Shows.

5. Ratings
* A Rating namely 'TV-MA' has been given to most of the movies/TV with the count of 2027.
* Whereas Rating 'Uc-17' has been given to only 2 content.

6. Desription of Movies/Tv-Shows
* By using Filter, I made a description board of movies and tv shows.
* I filtered the variables 'type' and 'title' & added the dropdown feature in the both the categorical variables wherein I could select any type and titles to view their details.
* Hence I created a **description board of movies and tv shows's duration, Ratings, Upload date, and Genre**

7. Dashboard
*Last but not the least I made dashboard to have better understanding of data overall and a apt clarity of insights.
